# ASAIR AM2315C Modbus Temperature & Humidity Transmitter (Modbus RTU Slave)

This repository contains examples and libraries for interfacing with the **ASAIR AM2315C** sensor—an industrial-grade temperature and humidity module that also functions as a **Modbus RTU transmitter (slave device)**. Use this to build Arduino/ESP Modbus clients that poll the AM2315C for environmental data via RS-485.
